List of files prep script - This converted and altered a shapefile, converting it to a csv document, that I could use to determine which images needed to be downloaded 
from the FEMA National Flood Hazard site.

Code for GIS Process scripts - As part of my analysis of changing FEMA flood zone maps, I needed to convert a large number (100+) PNG files to raster files that could be 
analyzed in QGIS and ArcMap. I designed loops to be repeatable, began the process in RStudio, and finished it in Python scripts, converting the files to vector data. 

Finishing Steps script - After analyzing the differences between FEMA flood zone maps across a seven year period, I brought the vector files into R and simplified them using 
for loops.

Irregular Code for GIS Process scripts - Some of my files were quite different from the ones that I began with. These new files were actually easier to work with, but still
required a slightly different process in R and Python to prepare them for analysis. 

Other scripts:
Arcpy Code 7.20 Dissolve - a test using the ArcPy library to see if dissolving my vector data would be helpful for my analysis.
